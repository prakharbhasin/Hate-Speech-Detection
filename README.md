### Description
Due to the massive rise of user-generated web content, particularly on social media networks, the amount of hate speech is steadily increasing. Hate speech online has been linked to a global increase in violence toward minorities, including mass shootings, lynchings, and ethnic cleansing. \
This paper provides a comprehensive and structured overview of automatic hate speech detection, and compares few of its current approaches in a systematic manner, along presenting an insightful review of some published research on cyberbullying detection approaches. 

### Dataset 
Tweets Dataset for Detection of Cyber-Trolls obtained from [DataTurks](https://www.kaggle.com/dataturks/dataset-for-detection-of-cybertrolls?select=Dataset+for+Detection+of+Cyber-Trolls.json)\
Data Cleaning, Preprocessing (Word Tokenization, Stemming, TF-IDF), and Resampling was done before application of any of the Machine Learning algorithms used. 

### Methods Used 
- Gaussian Naive Bayes 
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Adaboost Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier 

### Results 
The evaluation of the result shows that Ensemble supervised methods have the potential to perform better than traditional supervised methods. A number of directions forfuture work are also discussed.
